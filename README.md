Star-Rating.less
=======================

Makes the most basic star rating with html/css3 (and maybe 1 image)

```html
	<!-- this makes a 4 out of 5 star rating using a single image sprite -->
	<div class="stars"><span class="star4"></span></div>
	
	<!-- or a full font based approach -->
	<div class="stars-font star4">★★★★★</div>
```
